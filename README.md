# Parallel-Mandelbrot-Set-Generator
This repository hosts the implementation of a parallel Mandelbrot set generator. The code in Mandelbrot-parallel.cpp leverages multi-threading to compute the Mandelbrot set using either static or dynamic work allocation strategies. This project includes detailed performance analysis, comparing the efficiency of both work allocation methods
